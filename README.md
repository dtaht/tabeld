An exploration of C11, structure assignment, sse, a better netlink
library, and hashed lookups.

## An exploration of "pointerless programming"

the C idiom slings pointers around. The GO and rust idioms don't.
C++ doesn't, much either.

What if we tried to write in pure C something as lacking in pointers
as possible?

My first attempt here, has no pointers in it.

## C11

# going to use libnl

# Hashes?
